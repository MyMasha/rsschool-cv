## About Me
I am a beginner in front-end development with a strong desire to grow and expand my skills in this field. Although I am at the start of my journey, I bring a meticulous approach to problem-solving and am highly proficient in English, which helps me navigate resources and communicate effectively.

I’m drawn to front-end development because it combines both creativity and logic—allowing me to build visually appealing and interactive user experiences. I see this field as one with endless opportunities for growth and am excited to keep learning, as web development offers continuous development both in technical skills and in creative expression.

My strengths include attention to detail, thoroughness, and a deep commitment to developing new skills. I am eager to join a team where I can contribute, learn from others, and continue evolving as a front-end developer.
